<h1>Bianca Champenois</h1> <p>Hello! My name is Bianca, and I ride a Bianchi. My
name is Bianca, and drink Bianca mochas. My name is Bianca, and I am finishing
up my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering at UC Berkeley, and I will be
starting my PhD at MIT in the fall of 2020. </p> <p>In my free time, I like to
fix <a href="https://bicycal.berkeley.edu/">bikes</a>, play <a
href="https://youtu.be/ggSC01wrl9w">ultimate frisbee</a>, read <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/64552884">books</a>, and run around
Berkeley to find the best place to watch the sunset. I also enjoy <a
href="https://foutuegraphe.tumblr.com/tagged/foutuegraphe">darkroom
photography</a> and making things like <a
href="https://mache-machine.weebly.com/">this</a> or <a
href="https://binarymarbles.weebly.com/">that</a>.</p> </p>On a broad level, I
care about energy, sustainability, and mobility. On a more specific level, I am
interested in dynamics, controls, and using computer science and math to solve
relevant engineering problems. Above all, I am passionate about education and
social justice.</p> <p>At Berkeley, I worked in the Environmental Fluid
Mechanics and Hydrology lab where I ran experiments to quantify the effect of
surface flow on methane emissions from wetlands. During my summers, I did
research at the Tecnológico de Monterrey in Mexico on <a
href="Power-Converter-Poster.pdf">power converters</a> for renewable energy
integration and at the Technische Universität Hamburg in Germany on the control
of an ocean wave <a href="Pendulum-Poster.pdf">energy converter</a>. </p>
<p>Here is my <a href="CV.pdf">resume</a>. Reach me at bchamp [@] mit.edu</p>
