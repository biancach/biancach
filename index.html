      <h1>Bianca Champenois</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Bianca, and I am a senior at UC Berkeley in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. </p>
      <p>In my free time, I like to fix <a href="https://bicycal.berkeley.edu/">bikes</a>, play <a href="http://www.piequeens.org/">ultimate frisbee</a>, read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/64552884">books</a>, and run around Berkeley to find the best place to watch the sunset. I also enjoy <a href="https://foutuegraphe.tumblr.com/tagged/foutuegraphe">darkroom photography</a> and making <a href="https://binarymarbles.weebly.com/">things</a>. Recently, I have been learning how to tie knots, pick locks, and win minesweeper as fast as I can.</p>
      </p>On a broad level, I care about sustainability, energy, and transportation. On a more specific level, I am interested in dynamics, controls, and using computer science and math to solve relevant engineering problems. Above all, I am passionate about education. </p>
      <p>At Berkeley, I work in the Environmental Fluid Mechanics and Hydrology lab where I run experiments to quantify methane emissions from surface flow in wetlands. During my summers, I have done research at the Tecnológico de Monterrey in Mexico on <a href="Power-Converter-Poster.pdf">power converters</a> for renewable energy integration and at the Technische Universität Hamburg in Germany on the control of <a href="Pendulum-Poster.pdf">nonlinear systems</a> that can harvest ocean wave energy. </p>
      <p>Here is my <a href="CV.pdf">resume</a>. Reach me at blc [@] berkeley.edu</p>
